Implementation of the actor-critic model to play the game Hex. Monte Carlo Tree Search was used to create training data. This projects was done in regards to one of my classes in the spring of 2020.

The best run was with 'rung_long_OTH2/6_100_5000_11_100', which gave the scores 80, 84, and 92 in the verification tournament (hosted by the professor).
